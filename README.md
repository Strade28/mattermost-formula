# mattermost
Install, configure, and run `mattermost`.

**NOTE:** This is currently a work in progress, this will work on RHEL/CentOS machines, but needs to be configured to support Ubuntu/Debian.  At the moment the pillar file only supports the ServiceSettings under config.json, but more will be added soon.
