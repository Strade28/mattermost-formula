# mattermost
Install, configure, and run `mattermost`.

**NOTE:** This is currently a work in progress, this will work on RHEL/CentOS 7 and Ubuntu/Debian 16.04/9 machines, At the moment the pillar file only supports the ServiceSettings, TeamSettings, SQLSettings, PasswordSettings, FileSettings, Email Settings, and RateLimit Settings under config.json, more will be added soon.
